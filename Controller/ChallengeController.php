/**
 * <h1>Class ChallengeController</h1>
 *
 * A public (unauthenticated), read-only endpoint that the <altcha-widget>
 * fetches a fresh challenge from directly, in self-hosted mode.
 *
 * This exists because Mautic caches an entire form's RENDERED HTML in
 * `forms.cached_html` (see `Mautic\FormBundle\Model\FormModel::generateHtml()`
 * / `getContent()`) and only regenerates it when the form itself is saved -
 * not on every page view, and not every time preview is opened. A challenge
 * embedded directly into that cached HTML would be reused by every visitor
 * until the form is next saved, and would eventually expire while still
 * being served - which is exactly what caused "Verification failed. Try
 * again later." to appear on every attempt, deterministically, regardless
 * of what the challenge JSON itself contained. Pointing the widget's
 * "challengeurl" attribute at this endpoint instead (a URL, fetched live by
 * the visitor's browser at the moment the widget actually loads) sidesteps
 * that caching layer entirely - the same approach ALTCHA Sentinel already
 * uses, and what ALTCHA's own docs describe as the standard "server
 * integration" pattern for any dynamically-cached page.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain, invokable class (`__invoke()`), not a
 * Mautic\CoreBundle\Controller\FormController with a named *Action method -
 * Mautic's own plugin-config docs specifically show a bare `SomeClass::class`
 * reference (assuming an invokable controller) as the pattern for routes
 * registered under the "public" firewall, as opposed to the `[SomeClass,
 * 'methodName']` array pairing used for "main"/authenticated routes. Using
 * the array form here instead would make the route fail to resolve.
 * Beyond matching that convention, this route also needs no session, no
 * CSRF token, and no authentication (it has to work for anonymous visitors
 * on a public form), and it never renders a view or touches Mautic's admin
 * UI plumbing.
