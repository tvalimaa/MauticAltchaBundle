/**
 * <h1>Class AltchaClient</h1>
 *
 * Supports two mutually exclusive ways of running ALTCHA:
 *
 * 1. Self-hosted (default): Mautic generates and signs its own challenge
 *    with a local HMAC secret, and verifies the solution locally too. No
 *    outbound HTTP request is ever made - this is what makes plain ALTCHA
 *    privacy-friendly (no cookies, no external requests, no tracking).
 *
 * 2. ALTCHA Sentinel: challenges are issued directly by a Sentinel instance
 *    (self-hosted or ALTCHA Cloud) rather than by Mautic. The widget is
 *    pointed at Sentinel's own `/v1/challenge` endpoint, and Mautic only
 *    needs to verify the "server signature" Sentinel embeds in the
 *    submitted payload - which is itself a *local*, network-free HMAC
 *    check using the API key's secret, exactly as ALTCHA's own docs
 *    recommend (see https://altcha.org/docs/v2/server-integration/).
 *
 * If both a self-hosted HMAC secret and Sentinel credentials are filled in,
 * Sentinel takes precedence, since it's the more capable of the two.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: in self-hosted mode, the widget's "challengeurl" attribute is a
 * URL pointing at {@see \MauticPlugin\MauticAltchaBundle\Controller\ChallengeController}
 * - it is NOT an inline JSON challenge embedded directly into the form's
 * HTML. That used to be the design here, but Mautic caches an entire
 * form's rendered HTML in `forms.cached_html`
 * (`Mautic\FormBundle\Model\FormModel::generateHtml()`/`getContent()`) and
 * only regenerates it when the form itself is saved - not on every page
 * view or every time preview is opened. A challenge embedded directly in
 * that cached HTML would be reused by every single visitor until the form
 * is next saved, and would eventually expire while still being served -
 * which is exactly what caused "Verification failed. Try again later." to
 * appear on every attempt. Fetching the challenge from a URL at the moment
 * the widget actually loads sidesteps that caching layer entirely - it's
 * the same approach Sentinel mode already uses, and what ALTCHA's own docs
 * describe as the standard "server integration" pattern for any
 * dynamically-cached page.
